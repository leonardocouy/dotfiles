# Leo's dotfiles

Automate the boring stuff, right? Hahaha!

These dotfiles are fully customized to meet my necessities, but I hope that my dotfiles can serve to inspire you or be a starting point for you start your dotfiles project ;).

My dotfiles was built based on OSX!

## Installation

Run this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leonardocouy/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
source setup.sh
```

Nice! This will symlink the appropriate files in .dotfiles to your home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within ~/.dotfiles.

## Suggestions?

If you have a suggestion or found something that might improve on my dotfiles, I'll be very grateful if you can open a suggestion issue or else a PR!
